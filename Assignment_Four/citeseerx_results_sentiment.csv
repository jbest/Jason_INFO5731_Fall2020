NLP is focussed on the area of human computer interaction. The need for natural language processing was also felt because there is a wide storage of information recorded or stored in natural language that could be accessible via computers. Information is constantly generated in the form of books, news, business and government reports, and scientific papers, many of which are available online or even in some reports. A system requiring a great deal of information must be able to process natural language to retrieve much of the information available on computers. Natural language processing is an interesting and difficult field in which we have to develop and evaluate or analyse representation and reasoning theories.

10.1.1.406.4656,"Web has emerged as the most important source of information in the world. This has resulted in need for automated software components to analyze web pages and harvest useful information from them. However, in typical web pages the informative content is surrounded by a very high degree of noise in the form of advertisements, navigation bars, links to other content, etc. Often the noisy content is interspersed with the main content leaving no clean boundaries between them. This noisy content makes the problem of information harvesting from web pages much harder. Therefore, it is essential to be able to identify main content of a web page and automatically isolate it from noisy content for any further analysis. Most existing approaches rely on prior knowledge of website specific templates and hand-crafted rules specific to websites for extraction of relevant content. We propose a generic approach that does not require prior knowledge of website templates. While HTML DOM analysis and visual layout analysis approaches have sometimes been used, we believe that for higher accuracy in content extraction, the analyzing software needs to mimic a human user and under- stand content in natural language similar to the way humans intuitively do in order to eliminate noisy content.

10.1.1.15.139,"In this paper, we describe a framework for developing probabilistic classifiers in natural language processing. Our focus is on formulating models that capture the most important interdependencies among features, to avoid overfitting the data while also characterizing the data well. The class of probability models and the associated inference techniques described here were developed in mathematical statistics, and are widely used in artificial intelligence and applied statistics. Our goal is to make this model selection framework accessible to researchers in NLP, and provide pointers to available software and important references. In addition, we describe how the quality of the three determinants of classifier performance (the features, the form of the model, and the parameter estimates) can be separately evaluated. We also demonstrate the classification performance of these models in a large-scale experiment involving the disambiguation of 34 words taken from the HECTOR word sense corpus (Hanks 1996). In 10-fold cross-validations, the model search procedure performs significantly better than naive Bayes on 6 of the words without being significantly worse on any of them",neutral
10.1.1.87.7608,"Many Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have been used in Information Retrieval. The results are not encouraging. Simple methods (stopwording, porter-style stemming, etc.) usually yield significant improvements, while higher-level processing (chunking, parsing, word sense disambiguation, etc.) only yield very small improvements or even a decrease in accuracy. At the same time, higher-level methods increase the processing and storage cost dramatically. This makes them hard to use on large collections. We review NLP techniques and come to the conclusion that (a) NLP needs to be optimized for IR in order to be effective and (b) document retrieval is not an ideal application for NLP, at least given the current state-of-the-art in NLP.

We distinguish three kinds of methods that are  relevant to this enterprise: application methods, acquisition methods, and evaluation  methods. Using examples from the current literature, we show that all three kinds  of methods may be statistical in the sense that they involve the notion of probability  or other concepts from statistical theory.

Syntax-driven approaches use a domain-independent grammar to drive the interpretation process and produce a global parse of the input, accounting for each word of the sentence. Semantics-driven approaches use knowledge about the case frames of the verbs to drive the interpretation process. Early semantic parsers often ignored syntax altogether [1, 2] although more recent systems tend to integrate the two components whether primarily syntax or semantics driven (e.g., [3]).

The General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) was used as the platform for the development and execution of the IE application, which in-cluded most components of A Nearly New Information Extraction (ANNIE) system. Apart from the basic IE capabilities of ANNIE, the application fea-tured additional high-level annotation grammars written in the Java Annota-tion Patterns Engine (JAPE) language and a trainable annotator that used the maximum entropy machine learning model, which were designed to annotate several biographies of well-known mathematicians. The Prolog KB applica-tion, programmed to be executed within the XSB System, was designed to receive the annotated text output by the IE application and produce a knowl-edge base, and it successfully creates a database of Prolog facts that can be intelligently queried through the XSB System. The KB utilizes the frame representation of facts, specifically by treating one document as an object to be represented as a frame, with each annotation type treated as a slot whose multiple values are whichever specific strings were annotated by the IE appli-cation.

The present article overcomes this limitation by systematically investigating the performance of Web-based models for several NLP tasks, covering both syntax and semantics, both generation and analysis, and a wider range of n-grams and parts of speech than have been previously explored. For the majority of our tasks, we find that simple, unsupervised models perform better when n-gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus. In some cases, performance can be improved further by using backoff or interpolation techniques that combine Web counts and corpus counts. However, unsupervised Web-based models generally fail to outperform supervised state-ofthe-art models trained on smaller corpora.

The generalization process is a knowledge-based analysis of the causal structure of the narrative which removes unnecessary details while maintaining the validity of the causal explanation.
